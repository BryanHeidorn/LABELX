# PERL Program "FilterLabelsonWordFreqV2.pl"
#
# July 4, 2012
#
# This program accepts word list to serve as the basis for matching. It is assumed that a high count indicated good OCR.
# It is planned but not necessary that this list is created by finding frequently appearning words in the OCR output from
# photographs of museum labels. The hope is to eliminate sperious "words" created via OCR errors.
# The program also accepts a list of files names in which the words will be counted.
# The Dictionary must be sorted by frequency in assending order. The frequency followed by multiple spaces and then the word followed by new line
# Output: Stdout: "Filename #wordsmatched #tokens"
#
# Usage: FilterLabelsonWordFreq.pl DictionaryFile FilenameFile OutputFile
# Test for proper command line, exit if not

my %dictionary; # hash for the dictionary words
my $numargs;

   MinWords = number of words needed for a file to be acceptable.
   MinDictionaryFrequency = the minimum times a word must appear in the frequency dictionary before it is counted as a word.
   The DictionaryFile must be sorted by frequency in assending order. The frequenct followed by multiple spaces and then the 
   word followed by new line. The program CreateFrequencyDictionary.pl can do this.
   DictionaryMinCount must be a number. It is the minumum frequency that a word must appead in a collection before it is 
   counted as a countable word. The dictionary likley follows a Zipf distribution. Many OCR errors appear only once but make 
   up the majority of a dictionary.
   FilenameFile is where the file or directory to be tested. The system will recursively descend directory trees.
   OutputFile is where the results are stored.\n" ;
